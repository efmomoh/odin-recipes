                <h2>What Is Fried Rice?</h2>
                <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>
                <h2>How to Make Fried Rice</h2>
                <p>Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>⅔ cup chopped baby carrots</li>
                <li>½ cup frozen green peas</li>

                <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste (Optional)</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 cups leftover cooked white rice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
