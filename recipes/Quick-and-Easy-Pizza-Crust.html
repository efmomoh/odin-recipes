            <h2>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h2><br>
            <h2>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-pizza-dough/">pizza crust.</a></h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>Yeast</h3><br>
                <li>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
                <h3>Sugar</h3><br>
                <li>o activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/">activation process.</a> You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li>  
                <h3>Bread Flour</h3><br>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/"> Bread flour</a> is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
                <h3>Olive Oil</h3><br>
                <li>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
                <h3>Salt</h3><br>
                <li>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
                    <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
                    <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
